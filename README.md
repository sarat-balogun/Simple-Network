# Simple-Network
This is a simple network simulation, built using Cisco Packet tracer. It consist of a PC, a wireless router, a laptop, and a modem.
The Cable Modem is connected to the internet using a co-axial cable. 
The Cable Modem is then connected to the wireless router with a copper straight-through cable.
The PC is also connected to the wireless router with a copper straight-through cable and the laptop is connected wirelessly to the router. 
This project shows just the connection of devices through different media.
